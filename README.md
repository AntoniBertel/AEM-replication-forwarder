# AEM replication forwarder

You run a bunch of  instances in different locations and replication stuck during major content changes? 

This is the solution. Replication forwarder emulates the replication agent on HTTP level and allows to effectively 
accumulate and send data to any count of publish instances.

Ligweight, horisontally scalled, asyncronious.
